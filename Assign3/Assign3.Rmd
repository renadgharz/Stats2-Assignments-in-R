# 1. Midterm Scores
>A	Business School	offers	multiple	sections	of	a	second-year	introduction	to statistics	course,	which	is taught	by	three	instructors. Their	names	are	Dr.	Who,	Dr.	Jones	(Jr.),	and	Prof.	X. The	dataset	__Midterm	Scores__ contains the	midterm	scores	of	a	random	sample	of	students who took the	course	with	one	of	these instructors	over	the	last	several years.The	Business	School would	like	 to	 determine	whether	 the average midterm	 score differs among	these	three	instructors.

## 1.a
>Create a	side-by-side	boxplot	of	the	data	and	explain	whether the	similar	variance	and	the	nearly	normality	conditions	for conducting	an	ANOVA	seem	to	be	satisfied.



## 1.b
>In	addition	to	a	side-by-side	boxplot,	what	other	graphs	can	you	use	to	check	whether	the	conditions	for	using	an	ANOVA	are	satisfied?	Note:	You	donâ€™t	need	to	produce	the	graphs; only	explain	how	you	would	produce	them.



>__Answer	the	following	questions,	with	exception	of	part	g),	assuming	that	the	conditions	for	conducting	an	ANOVA	are	satisfied.__

## 1.c
>Use	 software	 to	 calculate	 the	 sample	 variance	 for	 each	 instructor and	 then	 use	 it	 to	calculate	 the	 pooled	 variance	manually.	 Verify	 that	 your	 pooled	 variance	 value	is	 the	same	as	the	MSE	value	displayed	in	the	partial	ANOVA	table	in	part	d)	below.



## 1.d
>Fill	 in	 manually	 the	 missing	 values	(1) to	(6) in	 the	 ANOVA	 table	 below.	 Show	 your computations	(maximum	of	2	decimal	places).	Check	your	results	using	software.



## 1.e
> Use	 the	 one-way	 ANOVA	 table	 you	 produced	 in	 part	 d)	 to	 test whether there	 is	 a	significant	difference	in	the	true	mean midterm	score	among the	three	instructors.	Use	the	critical	value	approach	and	a	5%	confidence	level.



## 1.f
> Use	 the	 Bonferroni	 method	 for	 multiple	 comparisons	 to	 determine	 which	 population	means	 differ	 (if	 any)	 at $\alpha=0.05$.	 Show	 your	 computations	 and	 clearly	 state	 your	conclusion	for	each	pairwise	comparison.



## 1.g
> Perform	a	Kruskal-Wallis	non-parametric	test	to	determine	whether	there	is	a	difference	in	the	midterm	scores across	the	three	instructors.	Use	a	5%	significance	level and	the	critical	value	approach. Is	 your	
conclusion	consistent	with	your	results	in	part	e)	above?



# 2. Utility Bills
>Supposed	 that,	 when	 comparing utility	 bills,	 a researcher	 was	 interested	 in	 determining	whether	residential	utility	bills	differed	among different	cities	in	Canada,	and	also	whether	they	 differed depending	 on	the	 number	 of	 bedrooms	 in	 a	 house.	As	 part	 of	 the	 study,	 a	random	sample	of	households	in	different	Canadian	cities	was	selected,	and	their	monthly	utility	 bills	 and	 number	 of	 bedrooms	were	 recorded.	 The	 data	is	 provided	in	 the	dataset __Utility	Bills__.

## 2.a
> Plot	the	residuals	against	the	fitted	values	corresponding	to	the	two-way	ANOVA	model	for	this	analysis.	What	two	key	model	assumptions	can	be	examined	with	this	plot	and	do	they	appear	to	be	warranted?



## 2.b
>Test	the	following	hypothesis	at	the	1%	significance	level. Use	software	to	generate	the	corresponding two-way	ANOVA	table,	but	show	any	other	computations.

>* Significant	interaction	effect	between	number	of	bedrooms	and	city;
>* Significant	main	effect	of	the	number	of	bedrooms	factor	(if	warranted);
>* Significant	main	effect	of	the	city	factor	(if	warranted).

## 2.c
>Create	 the	 corresponding	interaction	 plot	and	explain	if	it	 shows	interaction	 between	number	of	bedrooms	and	city.	Is	this	consistent	with	your	results	for	part	b)	above?



## 2.d
>Calculate	 the	 Bonferroni	 margin	 of	 error	 for	 the	 confidence	 intervals	 based	 on	 all	pairwise	differences	between	the	treatment	means.	Show	your	manual	calculations	and	use	an	overall	95%	confidence	level.



## 2.e
>Using	the	calculated	margin	of	error	from	part	d)	and	the	pairwise	confidence	interval	approach,	determine whether	there	is	sufficient	evidence	(at	the	5%	significance	level)	of	a	difference	in	mean monthly	utility	bills between	2-bedroom houses in	Ottawa	and	2-bedroom	houses	in	London
